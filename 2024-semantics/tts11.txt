Let's inspect the -I assume- well-known rule for the faculty function,
the thing to recognize is that a redex -a statement of work- might
result into more redexes or work to be done.

So, given that rule -with a bit of tinkering- we should know how to 
translate one step in the evaluation of a concrete instance of that
rule.

The redex is rewritten to a number of redexes. 'fac of five' will
result into three redexes that will decrement, compute the next 'fac', and
multiply the result.

Basically, any work will result into more work to be done, or some result
whereafter the remaining work will be done. 

And this all while maintaing the acyclic invariant, you can take another
moment to convince yourself that the above expansion didn't introduce
cycles.
