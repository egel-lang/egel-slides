The workhorse of the Egel language is the anonymous pattern
matches rewrite. It's close to a lambda abstraction except 
that it pattern matches.

Variable are always in uppercase to discriminate them from
constants. You can either bind variables or match against
constants in a pattern.

The pattern matching rewrite may consist of multiple alternatives
in which case they are matched in order.

Different from other functional languages, a pattern matching
rewrite in Egel can be a mix of any arity.

Let is just another form -or syntactic sugar- of such a rewrite.
