Egel has rudimentary support for namespaces and modules.

Modules behave similar to textual inclusion of the file referred to.
A transitive closure is calculated for all imports, that deals with
possible cycles.

Namespaces separate naming concerns in the standard manner though
support is rather rudimentary at this point in time.

The example puts it all together. As will be common for most short
Egel programs, the prelude module is imported after which all 
combinators in the system namespace are imported.

The Fibonacci function is defined in its standard recursive form
in its own namespace.

As is common, Egel batch scripts are driven by a main function when defined.
