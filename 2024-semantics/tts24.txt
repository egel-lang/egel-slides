The Egel interpreter is implemented in C++.

This allowed us to rely on C plus plus-es native reference counting and implement the interpreter without a garbage collector.

In the source code, combinators form a complex object-oriented hierarchy.

In order for people to make it easy to include Egel it is distributed in a header-only manner.

The uncompromising relaxation of constraints in the Egel language, aswell as the operational semantics, aswell as its naive C plus plus implementation bring a substantial performance burden.

Egel programs are very sluggish compared to programs in other languages, and the interpreter also isn't very user friendly.

At the moment, Egel isn't very useful except for experiments and short dirty scripts.
