Now for the magic, instead of developing an elaborate -usually stack- machine
we're simply going to change the representation of the term graph by naively
following our mental steps during the evaluation.

The first step is to recognize that the expression contains some work in the
for of reducible expressions, also named redexes.

These redexes can be evaluated in a specific order, and that is what the dotted
lines signify. We'll start in the lower-right corner.

Redexes may take arguments, those are pointed towards.

But a redex also has a result! And that result should go somewhere. The solid
lines pointing upward at empty boxes show where the result should go.
