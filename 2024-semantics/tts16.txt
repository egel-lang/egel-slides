The Egel language is a bare-bones front-end to the previous semantic model.

It is untyped, on purpose. When exploring an operational model it just makes
sense to not place too many restriction on the programs you can type in.

Since we don't want to place restrictions on programs, we actually go the
other route of relaxing as many constraints as we found useful.

That comes at a performance cost, it also means at any point in time you
can easily shoot yourself in the foot.

However, we're not totally leaving the academic garden. People will recognize
that the Egel language is close to a lambda calculus with constants in the
coming slides.
