The previous slides showed the gist of the Egel language. Of course,
there is more.

Though the Egel software is still in an alpha state, we dabbled with
various extensions and libraries.

Mutable references and mutable dictionaries were included for performance
reasons. Through mutation it's possible to create cycles in the term
graph and those won't be collected.

We added pipes and do notation, it's the prefered manner of dealing with
function application chains in Egel.

Literate programming is supported though -again- rudimentary, Egel will
just blindly execute code blocks in a markdown file.

And then there are various libraries in which we dabbled with regular
expression, remote execution of Egel programs, and a Python bridge.
