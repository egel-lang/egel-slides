We twisted the representation, though evaluation is straightforward and
we'll come to that, 

I coloured the pointer to the root of the graph red,
and there's something going on there, following that pointer you won't find
cycles.

We started of with a directed acyclic graph for an expression and twisting
the representation to elaborate the evaluation didn't change that.

Please take a moment to convince yourself that the shown graph is still
a directed acyclic one.
