The two most striking short-comings of the Egel interpreter are its speed and its unfriendliness and we do want to tackle both.

Egel programs are written in a dynamic manner so I want to concentrate on shortening the feedback loop with better error and tracing messages.

The poor performance of Egel isn't as easily tackled since I made a number of costly, or even very costly, design decisions.

In the long run, types should help, moving away from c plus plus should help, and realizing or borrowing a concurrent reference counting library should help too.

Maybe I'll get around to it for Egel, but at minimum I want to prove that the elaborated operational model can be made performant with a typed backend.
