As explained in the operational model, it's easy to support control flow operators
and concurrency; and we have implemented exactly that.

Try and catch is supported, any Egel value can be thrown and caught.

The one concurreny operator we support is async and await. The argument
to async need to be deferred with a lambda to make sure it'll be 
processed in it's own thread.
