Now we'll investigate the evaluation of the term graph. On
the left the original graph, on the right the term graph
after one reduction step.

Unsurprisingly, incrementing one results into two and that is
placed in a receiving array. After we've done that, the new
root of the graph becomes the next redex signalling that
there's more work to be done.
