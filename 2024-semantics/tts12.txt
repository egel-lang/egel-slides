Given the operational model presented in the previous
slides we have the mental model of the machinery
capable of evaluating any Turing-capable (functional)
language.

Despite that, one might find the need to express 
complex control flow directly in the term graph.

Egel, as an experiment, implements a bit more elaborate
model that mimicks exceptional control flow through
handlers.

Every thunk containing a redex is again expanded with
a special field refering to the exception handler for
that expression. In the picture, an example is show;
for clarity the handler pointers are coloured green.

The addition and throw redexes are a part of the
term that operate within a context of a given handler,
the identity function, and subsequently their exception
fields point to that handler.

The exception handler itself refers to the exception
handler of the outer context.

And, of course, the resulting graph is still directed
and acyclic.
