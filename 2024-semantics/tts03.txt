Let's dive into a bit of history and go back approximately seventy five years. At that
time researchers were investigating how to create useful languages, and one of the 
primary questions at that time -though it looks innocuous now- was how to evaluate
expressions. Once you can do that, you can start designing programming languages.

So the first step is to write down an expression, and its tree representation, and
ask yourself how you'ld design a machine that would evaluate that.
