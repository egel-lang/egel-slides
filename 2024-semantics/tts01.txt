Oh... Hi there! How are you?

I am Matilda, an Artificial Intelligence voice from Natural Readers. I'll be talking
you through the coming slides.

In this presentation we'll be discussing the Egel language and interpreter. We'll dive
into the graph semantics -how egel programs are evaluated-, explore the language,
review the current state of the interpreter, and set some future goals.
