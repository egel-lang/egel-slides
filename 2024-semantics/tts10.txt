Multiplying five with two gives ten. And at this point
evaluation will be stopped since there are no redexes,
or work to be done, left anymore.

We have shown how to evaluate small mathematical expressions
and that was all pretty much straightforward, but how does
that give the machinery for function evaluation?

Let's go to the next slide.
